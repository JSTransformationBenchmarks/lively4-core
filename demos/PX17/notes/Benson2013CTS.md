- "HTML pages still contain large amounts of “design scaffolding” needed to hierarchically layer content for proper presentation" [Benson2013CTS]

- "Cascading Tree Sheets (CTS), a CSS-like language for separating this presentational HTML from real content" [Benson2013CTS]
    - "how to graft presentational scaffolding onto their pure-content HTML" [Benson2013CTS]
    - separation of content from presentation
    - "Content HTML is wrapped in layers of presentational
HTML to provide anchor points for CSS, or to control blocklevel layout beyond CSS’s capabilities."
    - state of the art: "To reuse markup, she must copy the entire blob, then find and replace the right pieces of content with her own. "

- "CTS uses CSS selectors and syntax to graft presentational HTML onto content HTML."
- "CTS helps a web designer fully partition an HTML document into its content and presentational halves"
- example: "Novices can annotate an HTML table with a CSS class that transforms it into a Google Map."
- "themes and proper encapsulation without having to use a Content Management System"
- example: "a professor could change the layout of every publication on her web site by changing one line of HTML to link to a different tree sheet instead of laboriously modifying the HTML for each publication"
