# Lively4

- what it is
- what it should be
  - what we aim / aimed for?
- what it can not be


## We created Lively Kernel, because:

- we like a smalltalk-like PX
  - working directly with objects
  - programming at run
- we like share and use each others idea projects on direct informal  (wiki-like) way

- we like to evolve tools while using them
- we like to tools that allow us to work directly on objects and the running application on a UI level... and don't like to be restricted to editing source code
- think, rich text editors vs. only editing LaTeX 


## We developed Lively4 from scratch, because:


- we want to bring the form of Lively Kernel-like development to native Web-programming technologies: HTML, JavaScript, CSS


## Approach

- Apply a Lively Kernel / Smalltalkish development approach to class HTML/JavaScript/CSS technology
- Graph of JavaScript objects  vs. tree of HTML elements with explicit links throuhg ids and urls
- working objects vs. working with files (text streams) again
- How to work in a lively way with "dead files"?
