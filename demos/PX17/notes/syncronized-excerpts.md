# #Meta #Idea Bidirectional notepad for each paper (or many papers)

As we have successfully tried out with GitHub issues, it is not only possible to generate a custom view into a database of issues. We also managed to synchronized a handwritten list of issues with the GitHub project's issue list. We could created new issues in the markdown file or in the database and they got updated appropriately. This allowed us to relate the issues in an external context. We could even use them in the context of journaling pages. 

While working on my thesis I managed to automatically extract my notes on papers in a way that they served as excerpts and could be browsed and navigated in the context of my other notes. The problem was that those file were generated and could not be used as a starting point for adding further notes or arranging them in a different order. To add to the notes one had to go back into the pdf document and add the comments and new thoughts as annotation. 

What would still extract annotations into an markdow/html document, but instead of overwriting it and rendering it through this at read only, we would carefully and potentially (bidirectionally synchronize the markdown notes with the notes in the PDF file) #Project #Idea
