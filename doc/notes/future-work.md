# Future Work

- Workflow of live object based editing of components
- Cutting out any HTML objects as templates on the Web and reusing them later (in mashups)?


## Hash-tag Navigation #DONE

Immediatly transform all #Hashtags in [lively-container](search://name=lively-container.js) and ace editors into active links that open a context menu with actual links to the various sites.

The links have to be provideded by a service (nodejs or service worker), they should either be updated actively after chaning conent or generated by a search bot... e.g. can we use travis for this? We would ideally not store the results back into the same repository.

Means for storing the links:

- one file in file system
- elastic search or similar service (fulltext search possible)
- any key value store
<div class="lively-content" style="width: 800px; height: max-content; position: absolute; left: 364px; top: 293.6px;"> <!--StartFragment--> <!--EndFragment--></div>
