# Draw.io

Drawio is used to create figures in Lively4:
- create a new drawing through context menu in navbar
- reference drawing like other images in markdown
- select "edit @ drawio" drawing in context menu
  - the drawing should automatically be updated (#BUG sometimes it does not happen)
  - select "update from drawio" in context menu
- select "export as pdf" drawing in context menu to create a pdf that can be used in LaTeX
