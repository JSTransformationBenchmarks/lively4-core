# Booting / Loading of Lively4


Initially, we were not clear on how to navigate from lively page to lively page. To not "boot" Lively4 on every page load and to access all the files, we now use an initial "jump" page.

One can be able to browse all kind of content:

```
https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/lively4-core/start.html?load=/README.md

```
To edit files directly, one can use "edit" instead of "load":
```
https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/lively4-core/start.html?edit=/README.md
```
