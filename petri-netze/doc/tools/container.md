The container is a browser inside the Web-browser. It can navigate, render, and edit pages without using the Web-browser to navigate to a different page. This allows to navigate and edit multiples pages in one place.


## Naming

The Container is called "container" because it contains other resources, but since it is more to browse and edit those resources we might just rename it "Browser". This would even fit the tradition of the "System Browser" in Smalltalk as the main tool in our Self-sustaining development environment.
