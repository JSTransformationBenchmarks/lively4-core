# Writing

We use the Lively4 wiki like features to document and reflect about itself... and work on other projects.




## With the Lively [Container](../tools/container.md), we can

- Create Markdown files / Wiki pages
- Create Presentations as markdown files
- Create active content, e.g. visualizations, inside of Markdown files
- Embed Markdown content in JavaScript files as documentation 
  - that get also rendered while in editing mode
